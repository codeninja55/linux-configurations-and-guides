# Setting up Ubuntu 18.04





## Anaconda Virtual Environment

When managing software development environments, particularly those with complex libraries such those for machine and deep learning, I prefer to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/). You could also use [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - a more lightweight version of Anaconda. 

Follow the steps in this [guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to install Anaconda in Ubuntu.

```bash
$ conda list --explicit > 
```
